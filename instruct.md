# Ollama UI Web App – Detailed Design Specification

This document outlines the design for a web-based UI application that leverages the Ollama API. The goal is to provide users with an intuitive, feature-rich interface for interacting with locally hosted language models powered by Ollama.

---

## 1. Overview

The Ollama UI Web App serves as a front-end client for the Ollama local server, allowing users to:
- Interact with language models via a chat-like interface.
- Manage and switch between available models.
- Configure query parameters for tailored responses.
- View session histories and logs for review and export.

This design will enhance the user experience by abstracting API complexities and offering a modern, responsive web application.

## 2. Architecture & Technology Stack

### Architecture
- **Client-Server Model:**  
  - **Frontend:** A single-page application (SPA) built with a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular).
  - **Backend/API Integration:** Direct communication with the locally running Ollama API server via RESTful endpoints.

- **Communication:**  
  - REST API calls (using fetch or Axios) with JSON-formatted requests and responses.
  - WebSockets can be considered for real-time query status updates if supported by the Ollama API.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React (or your preferred framework)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for rapid UI development
- **State Management:** Redux, Context API, or similar for managing chat sessions and configuration settings
- **API Communication:** REST client (Axios/Fetch)
- **Local Hosting:** The UI app communicates directly with the locally running Ollama API server

## 3. User Interface & Experience

### 3.1. Main Dashboard / Chat Interface
- **Components:**
  - **Chat Window:** Displays conversation threads with distinct message bubbles for user inputs and model responses.
  - **Input Area:** A rich text input field with support for markdown formatting.
  - **Send Button:** Triggers the API call to submit queries.
  - **Status Indicator:** Visual cue (e.g., spinner or progress bar) indicating when a response is being processed.
  
- **User Flow:**
  1. User types a query or command.
  2. Clicks “Send” or presses Enter.
  3. The app sends the query to the Ollama API.
  4. The response is streamed/displayed in the chat window.
  5. The conversation history is updated and stored locally.

### 3.2. Model Selection & Management Panel
- **Components:**
  - **Model List:** A sidebar or modal listing all available models, fetched from the Ollama API.
  - **Model Details:** When a model is selected, show its specifications, version, and usage metrics.
  - **Switch Model:** Option to change the active model for the session.
  
- **User Flow:**
  1. On app load, the UI fetches the model list using the API.
  2. Users select a model from the list.
  3. The selection updates the active model, influencing subsequent queries.

### 3.3. Configuration & Settings
- **Components:**
  - **Parameter Controls:** Sliders or input fields for adjusting parameters such as:
    - Temperature
    - Max tokens
    - Top-p
    - Frequency penalty
  - **Custom Prompt Templates:** Allow users to define or select templates for specific use cases.
  
- **User Flow:**
  1. Navigate to the settings section.
  2. Adjust model parameters or choose a prompt template.
  3. These settings are appended to the API request payload.

### 3.4. Session History & Logging
- **Components:**
  - **History Panel:** A scrollable list of past interactions with timestamps.
  - **Export/Import Options:** Functionality to export the chat history or import previous sessions.
  
- **User Flow:**
  1. The app logs each session automatically.
  2. Users can review and export the history for later reference.

## 4. API Integration

### Key API Endpoints and Their Purposes

- **Model Management:**
  - `GET /api/v1/models`  
    *Purpose:* Retrieve a list of available models along with their metadata.
  - `GET /api/v1/models/{model_id}`  
    *Purpose:* Fetch detailed information about a specific model.
  - `POST /api/v1/model/load` *(if supported)*  
    *Purpose:* Load or initialize a new model instance.

- **Query Execution:**
  - `POST /api/v1/query`  
    *Purpose:* Submit a user query to the active model. The payload may include:
    - `prompt`: The user input.
    - `model`: The selected model identifier.
    - `parameters`: Configuration settings (temperature, max tokens, etc.).
  - `GET /api/v1/query/status`  
    *Purpose:* Check the processing status of a submitted query.
  - **Optional – Streaming Endpoint:**  
    - If Ollama supports real-time streaming, a WebSocket endpoint could be used for a smoother experience.

- **Configuration:**
  - `POST /api/v1/config` *(if applicable)*  
    *Purpose:* Set or update global or model-specific configurations dynamically.

## 5. Detailed Feature Descriptions

### 5.1. Chat Interaction
- **Functionality:**  
  - Real-time submission and display of conversation threads.
  - Handling multi-turn conversations with context retention.
- **Design Considerations:**  
  - Message formatting and markdown rendering.
  - Error handling for API failures (e.g., timeouts, invalid responses).

### 5.2. Model Management
- **Functionality:**  
  - Dynamic retrieval and display of models.
  - Switching between models during an active session.
- **Design Considerations:**  
  - Cache model list locally for faster access.
  - Provide clear indicators of the currently active model.

### 5.3. Customization & Settings
- **Functionality:**  
  - Allow users to tune parameters that affect the model's output.
  - Save custom settings for future sessions.
- **Design Considerations:**  
  - Use local storage or a backend service to persist user preferences.
  - Provide immediate visual feedback when settings are adjusted.

### 5.4. Session History
- **Functionality:**  
  - Archive conversations with timestamps.
  - Option to export history in common formats (e.g., JSON, Markdown).
- **Design Considerations:**  
  - Ensure that session logs are searchable and filterable.
  - Allow deletion or clearing of old sessions to manage local storage.
